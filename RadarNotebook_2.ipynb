        "Conversion to dB’s is also typically the standard measure for powers, amongst several other uses. The ‘ratio’ in this regard, is with respect to some absolute linear unit, such as the Watt. The nomenclature in this case, usually places a letter after the dB, to inform you what the base unit is. For instance, 3 dBW represents 2 W of electrical power. However, in practice, 1 W or 1 dBW is quite a large amount of power, when we consider that the receiver sees powers in the nanowatt regime. A more conventional unit is the dBm, which is based on the milliwatt.  \n",

        "To convert from dBW to dBm, simply add 30. Example, 10dBW = 10+30 = 40 dBm.\n",

        "Other dB scales are also typically used such as dBi for antenna gain, which represents the gain of an antenna over an isotropic antenna (we’ll talk about antenna gain in the next section), or the dBc, which is a power relative to the Carrier.\n",

        "\n",
        "dB’s are incredibly useful for quickly calculating the signal level in cascaded chains of components, where there are gains and losses. A radar system is essentially composed of cascaded elements, which we’ll see in the Hardware section. For instance, let’s suppose the following cascaded system:\n",

        "$$P_{out} = P_{in}+A+B+C+D = 30+10+(−5)+(−6)+4 = 33 dB$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, using the dB scale allows us to graphically represent values of vastly different proportions. This is particularly helpful, when we consider that a radar may have a 1kW transmitter, but a receiver that measures nanowatts, or 1000 vs 0.000 000 001 (15 orders of magnitude). Below are 2 plots that show this discrepancy.\n",

        "In a standard linear scale, it’s difficult to plot values of vastly different sizes on the same graph. dB based scales, simplify this issue, where every 10 dB difference is 10 times larger. \n",

        "\n",
        "Whilst different radars are built for unique applications, the radar’s achievable range should be a fundamental design parameter of any radar. How far can you detect an incoming missile, or what is the maximum vehicle separation in autonomous radar? It’s so important, that the formula for it is simply known as the Radar Range Equation. Anyone diving into radar should derive it from first principles, so that its meaning can be fully understood.\n"

        "Let’s start with the simplest case of an isotropic antenna. The term Isotropic means ‘ having a physical property which has the same value when measured in different directions’, which in the case of radar, means that the transmitted power is the same at all equal distances, in all directions as shown by the green sphere in the figure below (image credit: https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Effective_radiated_power). \n",

        "Now, because energy cannot be created or destroyed, and is being radiated away equally in all directions, the signal power in some volume of space, must decrease the further the volume is away from the transmitter, so that the total transmitted power at that distance is conserved. \n",
        "\n",
        "Due to the spherical nature of the radiation, the decrease in power happens with a ratio of $R^2$, where R is the distance from the transmitter. We can therefore determine what Power, $P_{orx}$, some $1m^2$ object of at Range of R will intersect, given a certain amount of Isotropically transmitted power, $P_{tx}$.\n",

        "\n",
        "However, a target at some range R, is unlikely to have an exact cross section of $1m^2$. In fact, the idea of a purely geometric area isn’t really true in Radar. Rather, objects have what is known as a Radar Cross Section (RCS), which is a measure of how much EM radiation they will reflect for a given Radio frequency, and how the radiating body interacts with the EM. There is a lot to unwrap with RCS, so for now we will just give it the symbol $\\sigma$ and note that it is also measured in $m^2$. \n",
        "\n",
        "The amount of power found in $1m^2$ patch of the isotropic sphere at R from the object, is then the total power $P_{orx}$ retransmitted by the object with an RCS of $\\sigma$. Again, the power radiated falls off with an $R^2$ dependence.\n",

Detection is the first step in many radar processors, and can essentially be boiled down to the statement, ‘is there, or isn’t there a target?’. On the surface this seems simple, considering that you are looking for a ‘voltage spike’ in your recorded data. In reality, this can be quite challenging due to the presence of noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "A side effect of noise is that, completely random signals will enter our receiver, and appear to be targets if we have no definition of what contributes as ‘a target’. The simplest way to discern between signal and noise, is to place a threshold value in our processing stage. The threshold essentially makes a binary decision that there is a target if the received power is above the threshold, and that we may ignore any value below this threshold. Take a look at the figure below that demonstrates this idea [1]. Choosing an optimal value for this threshold is not simple, and has to do with the probability that we make a true detection, $P_D$, and the probability that there is a false alarm, $P_{FA}$, meaning that we detect noise as a target.\n",
